# Apple IIgs Toolbox

This repository contains information about the API calls of the Apple IIgs Toolbox.

The Toolbox is a set of (patchable) firmware calls you can make to do things like allocate memory, draw desktop UI controls, handle events, open files, and so much more.

In fact you can create your own toolset and release it as a new Tool, and this has recently been done with things like MOD music players and TCPIP libraries.
